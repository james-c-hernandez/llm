Each player starts with $1500 cash. Determine who goes first any method agreed on by the players.

On your turn, roll the dice and move that many spaces counterclockwise around the board (unless you're in jail, more on that later).

If you land on a property no one owns, you have the choice to buy it from the bank -- pay the appropriate amount of money and take the deed card. If you choose not to buy it, it's auctioned off. (Someone please help me with the rules on this, as it's the one official rule me and my friends never follow.)

If you land on a property another player owns, you pay the amount listed as rent on the deed card. Technically, the other player has to call you out on this -- if the next person begins their turn and no exchange of money happens, they're under no obligation to pay.

If you land on a property you own, nothing happens.

If you land on Free Parking, nothing happens.

If you land on Jail, you're just visiting, and again, nothing happens.

If you land on Go To Jail, then move directly to the jail space.

If you land on or pass Go, collect $200 from the bank.

If you land on a Chance or Community Chest space, draw the top card from the appropriate stack and follow the instructions. If they involve moving to a new square, they travel the same way pieces normally move, and thus can collect money for passing Go (except for Go To Jail cards).

If you land on a tax space, pay the appropriate amount of money.

Finally, if you rolled the same number on both dice, immediately take a second turn after this one. If you roll doubles again, take a third turn. If you roll doubles a third time, ignore the number rolled and go directly to jail.

If you're in jail, you must roll doubles to get out - if you do, move the appropriate number of spaces and take the rest of your turn as usual. Alternatively, you may pay $50 (before you roll the dice) to get out immediately. If on your third turn, you still haven't rolled doubles, you must pay $50 and use whatever you rolled on that turn.

Before any turn, players may trade properties with each other. Cash and other properties are fair game for trading -- as long as both players agree to the terms, just trade the appropriate deed cards and money.

If a player owns all properties of a color group (a monopoly), they can build houses and hotels on them. The cost for a house or hotel is listed on the deed card, but generally the more expensive the property, the more expensive to build on. Note that you must build evenly on that group -- you can't put a second house on a property until all the other properties of that color have a house. Once you have four houses, then they upgrade to a hotel. Note that unlike money, houses and hotels have a limited stock, so once you've put them all into play, you can't build anymore unless someone sells it back. Houses and hotels increase the rent charged to other players for landing on that space. A property without houses or hotels but still in a monopoly gets double the usual rent as well.

Note that railroads and utilities aren't in a color group and can't have houses and hotels, though they get an immediate bonus if you have more than one of them.

If a player is short on cash, even if they're in the middle of a transaction to the bank or another player, they can sell houses and hotels back to the bank for half their purchase cost. If it hasn't been built on, they can also mortgage a property, receiving the money listed on the deed card. While it's mortgaged, they receive no rent from other players. Un-mortgaging can be done before a player rolls the dice and costs the same cash it costed to mortgage it plus 10%. (Also note that if a mortgaged property is traded, it stays mortgaged.)

If a player has to pay someone else or the bank more than they have, and can't sell/mortgage property to cover the cost, the game ends. Whoever has the most money (counting both cash on hand and the value of property and buildings on them) is the winner!
